== How to run this code ==

How to run this code:

$ sudo apt-get install rabbitmq-server python-apt
$ sudo rabbitmqctl add_user rabbiter johT4qui
$ sudo rabbitmqctl add_vhost localhost
$ rabbitmqctl set_permissions -p localhost rabbiter "" ".*" ".*" || rabbitmqctl map_user_vhost rabbiter localhost || echo EEEP

$ python bootstrap.py
$ ./bin/buildout
$ ./bin/mysite runserver

Now load http://127.0.0.1:8000/search/ in your web browser.

== Testing ==

To run all tests, except customs:

./bin/test_with_testsettings_without_customs

To run all tests, including customs:

./bin/test_with_testsettings_without_customs

To run just a particular test:

./bin/mysite_with_testsettings_for_testing_with_customs test profile

This is all necessary due to our need for DEBUG_PROPAGATE_EXCEPTIONS. See
the notes in README.twill-tests to understand what's going on.

== To forcibly regenerate scripts in ./bin/* ==

$ python bootstrap.py
$ ./bin/buildout -o # o is for "offline", so you don't hit the network looking for dependencies
