== How to run this code ==

$ sudo apt-get install rabbitmq-server python-apt
$ sudo rabbitmqctl add_user rabbiter johT4qui
$ sudo rabbitmqctl add_vhost localhost
$ sudo rabbitmqctl set_permissions -p localhost rabbiter "" ".*" ".*" || sudo rabbitmqctl map_user_vhost rabbiter localhost || echo "Failed to set rabbitmq permissions. Complain to Asheesh."

FIXME: Explain how to create MySQL user oh_milestone_a and grant select permissions.

$ python bootstrap.py
$ ./bin/buildout # Make sure you're actually in this directory
$ ./bin/mysite runserver

Now load http://127.0.0.1:8000/search/ in your web browser.

== Testing ==

To run all tests, except customs:

./bin/test

To test customs:

./bin/mysite test customs

== To forcibly regenerate scripts in ./bin/* ==

$ cd milestone-a # Make sure you're in this directory. Not sure if it will work elsewhere.
$ python bootstrap.py
$ ./bin/buildout -o # o is for "offline", so you don't hit the network looking for dependencies
