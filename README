== How to run this code ==

$ sudo apt-get install rabbitmq-server python2.5-dev python-apt
$ sudo rabbitmqctl add_user rabbiter johT4qui
$ sudo rabbitmqctl add_vhost localhost
$ sudo rabbitmqctl set_permissions -p localhost rabbiter "" ".*" ".*" || sudo rabbitmqctl map_user_vhost rabbiter localhost || echo "Failed to set rabbitmq permissions. Complain to Asheesh."

FIXME: Explain how to create MySQL user oh_milestone_a and grant select permissions.

$ python2.5 bootstrap.py
$ ./bin/buildout # Make sure you're actually in this directory
$ ./bin/mysite runserver

# Set up the database.
mysql -u root -p < "CREATE DATABASE; CREATE USER 'oh_milestone_a'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'ahmaC0Th'; GRANT ALL ON oh_milestone_a.* TO 'oh_milestona_a'@'localhost';
# Or use 'mysql -u username', where username is a MySQL user with the appropriate privileges.

../bin/mysite syncdb

Note that you must answer "No" to the question, "Do you want to create a superuser?"

That is because you have not run the migrations for the "Profile" app yet.

# You may need to migrate using this command:
../bin/mysite migrate

# Sometimes the migrations don't work, and South will give you a MySQL script. Your next challenge, wee padawan, is to fix the syntax errors in this MySQL. Run this vim command for starters.
:%s/^ = //
# For non-vimmers, that means "Delete the string ' = ' when it appears at the beginnings of lines."
# Then remove those trailing square brackets.
# Regarding dates. You may need to replace South's strange Pythonesque code for dates with proper MySQL code.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Q. Why is the Django project called 'mysite'?

== Testing ==

To run all tests, except customs:

./bin/test

To test customs:

./bin/mysite test customs

== To forcibly regenerate scripts in ./bin/* ==

$ cd milestone-a # Make sure you're in this directory. Not sure if it will work elsewhere.
$ python bootstrap.py
$ ./bin/buildout -o # o is for "offline", so you don't hit the network looking for dependencies
