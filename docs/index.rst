Welcome to OpenHatch's documentation
====================================

You've reached the documentation for `OpenHatch <http://openhatch.org/>`_.  

Trying to get your bearings?  Take a look at the :doc:`contributor/project_overview` or :doc:`contributor/contact` us to ask questions.

Some popular documentation pages include:

* :doc:`contributor/index`
* :doc:`deployment/installation`
* Adding a bug tracker `through the web interface <http://openhatch.readthedocs.org/en/latest/tutorials/adding_a_new_bug_tracker.html>`_ or `via github <http://openhatch.readthedocs.org/en/latest/internals/adding_bug_tracker.html>`_

We've also got a `wiki <https://openhatch.org/wiki/Main_Page>`_ with a lot of informal documentation and other useful things on it.
