  <div class="body">
      <p>Most open source projects keep their code in a version control system (VCS).  Subversion is a popular VCS for open source projects.  Subversion is a non-distributed VCS, meaning that there is a single central repository that all users and developers interact with.</p>
      <p>A VCS tracks changes that are made to the code.  Each change has a timestamp, an author name, and a log message associated with it.  If two people modify the same file, the VCS catches this and merges both sets of changes; the second person is shown any conflicts that occur so the conflicts can be resolved.  One can also look through the history of the codebase.</p>
