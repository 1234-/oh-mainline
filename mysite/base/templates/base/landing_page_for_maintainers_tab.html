	<h5>How to use these people</h5>
	<p>When you're ready to ask for help on your project, these are good people to reach out to.
	  You can recruit them via email and suggest a ticket, or ask them to come to events you might run.
	  <a href="http://openhatch.org/wiki/Contacting_new_contributors">Read more ideas</a>.</p>

        <p>None of your projects have people waiting to contribute at this moment.
	As people click the "I want to help" button on a project page, the projects will be listed here.</p>

      <div class="body">
	<p>Your profile says you've contributed to some projects. Now,
	  edit the project page to explain how new contributors can get involved.
	</p>
	<p>This is your chance to make your project feel inviting to
	  prospective contributors. Start at your profile, open your
	  project pages, and answer the questions!</p>

	<p>OpenHatch would be happy to show bugs from your projects in the
	  <a href="{% url mysite.search.views.fetch_bugs %}">volunteer opportunity finder</a>.
	  To do that, you have to edit the project information and add a
	  bug tracker to our system. We will crawl it nightly.

      <h3>Tips on finding more contributors</h3>
      <div class="body">
	<p>Most projects have only one active developer. How can you go from
	  zero collaborators to more? Here are our tips:</p>
	<ul class="raquo_bullets">
	  <li>Find local colleges and universities with computer clubs or
	    computer science departments. Email them and tell them how cool your project is.</li>
	  <li>Give a talk at a local programming language meetup about your project.</li>
	  <li>Run an online event to attract contributors. <a href="http://openhatch.org/wiki/Build_it">Read more on our wiki</a>.</li>
	  <li>Join #openhatch on irc.freenode.net and see if we have other ideas.</li>
