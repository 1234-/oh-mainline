		  Come hang out with us! OpenHatch is an open source community of its own, and we invite people of all levels. You can dive in and
		  organize events, mentor new contributors, or improve this Python+Django
		  website. We also just want friendly, helpful, or knowledgeable people to hang out in our IRC channel.
