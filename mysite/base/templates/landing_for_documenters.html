                    Automagically import your contributions from other networks</a></h4>

            <p>Your OpenHatch profile is where you can write about your
                involvement in free/open source projects. People contribute in
                lots of ways: code, documentation, translations, bug reports,
                packaging, and more.</p>

            <p>The profile editor contains an importer to pull in what we can
                find via other websites. When you search for yourself, we
                examine project hosting sites and source code repositories.
                {% comment %}(You can see the current list of supported profile import
                    sites </wiki/something>.) {% endcomment %}
                The profile we put together
                combines the trails you've left behind on other websites.</p>

            <h4>Add what we missed</h4>

            <p>The OpenHatch importer can't find the patches you submit to
                mailing lists or the work you did organizing a documentation
                sprint. Since we can't always detect all your contributions,
                the profile editor lets you click to add a project.</p>

            <p>Your OpenHatch profile serves as a reminder to yourself of all
                the cool things you've done. It's also smart to maintain a
                portfolio of your free software work so you can put it on your
                resume.</p>

            <h4><a href=''>Grab your widget</a></h4>

            <p>When your profile is ready, you can embed your OpenHatch profile
                on your own web things. You'll find a widget waiting in your
                personal settings.</p>

            <h4>Your project description defines the project</h4>

            <p>When you add a project to your profile, you appear on that
                project's page on OpenHatch. On that page, we take a random
                contributor's description of the project to give a voice to all
                the people involved.</p>
