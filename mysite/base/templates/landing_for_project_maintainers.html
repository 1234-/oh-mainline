            <h3>Recruiting people to your project</h3>
        </div>

<h4>Write about what you're looking for</h4>

<p>Every project could use some help. How can you tell prospective contributors what they could do?</p>

<p>The project page on OpenHatch helps people understand how they could fit in.
    You can write about how to get the source, suggest appropriate tasks for a
    newcomer, explain how non-coders can a difference, or list issues that you
    especially want help with.</p>

<p>To do that, just start a page for your project </+project/>.</p>

<h4>Add your bug tracker</h4>

<p>OpenHatch can show bugs from your bug tracker as volunteer opportunities.
    Right now, we support importing bugs from Roundup, Bugzilla, Launchpad, and
    Trac; we can add more fairly easily.</p>

<p>If you label good bugs for newcomers with a tag and let us know, we'll mark
    those bugs as "bitesized." We can do the same for bugs targeted at your
    documentation.</p>

<p>To add a bug tracker to our nightly crawl,
    <a href="/wiki/Bug_trackers">leave a note on our wiki</a>.</p>

<h4>Find people who can pitch in</h4>

<p>If you're looking for help with a specific sort of issue -- say, Windows testing or Unicode safety -- you might find there's someone already on OpenHatch who wants to pitch in. Or maybe there are fellow programmers in your neighborhood who would attend a weekend hacking event.</p>

<p>Reach out! Try sending a friendly email to the <a href="{% url mysite.profile.views.people %}">people you can find on the map</a>.</p>

<h4>Let people know you want help</h4>

<p>Many project websites explain how coders can get involved but have nothing for people who want to participate in other ways. Your OpenHatch project page lets people say they are willing to contribute, standing waiting for an assignment. After they do that, you can see their skills and contact them. And you can show that button on your own project website to let people know you're open to help.</p>
