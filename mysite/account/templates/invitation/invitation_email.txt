{% load base_extras %}Hi there. I am a robot. A human named {% with invitation_key|invitation_key2user as u %}{% with u.get_full_name as n %}{{ n }}{% if n %} ({% endif %}{{ u.username }}{% if n %}){% endif %}{% endwith %}{% endwith %} asked me to let you know about a website called OpenHatch. OpenHatch
<https://openhatch.org> makes it easier to find
interesting things to do in free/libre/open source software (aka FLOSS), or at least that's the idea.

Here 'tis: https://openhatch.org/

Other stuff:
* Find a cool bug (we index hundreds of major projects): https://openhatch.org/search/
* Find other folks in FLOSS and learn what they do: https://openhatch.org/people/
* Chat about FLOSS projects: https://openhatch.org/+projects/

Kind regards,

A Robot
