<p>Your first mission is to obtain a copy of the remote git repository. For this mission, we will use the git repository you created in step one.  Running the following command will clone the remote repository and create a copy on your hard drive.</p>

<p>You can clone the repository by running:<br style="clear: left;" />
<code>git clone {{ checkout_url }} git_missions</code>

<p>Once you have a copy of the repository, open hello_world.py to read the comments and see if you can find the name of the author responsible for this mishap!</p>
