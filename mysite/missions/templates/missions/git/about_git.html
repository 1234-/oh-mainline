<p>Git is a version control system (VCS) created by Linus Torvalds,  the creator of the Linux kernel. Git is known as a 'distributed” VCS, or DVCS. This means that each user's copy of the code is a fully working repository and includes all previous commit information.  Rather than connecting to a remote server as you would with Subversion or CVS, users can work productively offline, choosing to later sync their changes with a remote repository or create a patch file.</p>

<p>The purpose of this mission is to teach you how to clone a remote repository, make changes to a file, check them into your local copy, and finally create a patch file.</p>

<h3>Preparing for the mission</h3>
<ul class="raquo_bullets">
  <li>Install git onto your machine.  In linux, the package is typically named "git-core" and is likely available via your package manager.  The <a href="http://git-scm.com/download">git website</a> contains options for downloading the latest version and builds for other platforms.</li>
  <li>Configure your user name: git config --global user.name 'First Last'</li>
  <li>Configure your user email: git config --global user.email 'name@domain.com'</li>
</ul>

{% if user.is_authenticated %}
<p>(If your project recommends this tutorial to newcomers, we can put you in a list here!)</p>
{% endif %}

<h3>Other resources</h3>

<ul class="raquo_bullets">
  <li>The <a href="http://git-scm.com/">website</a> for the git project contains a quickstart guide and links to <a href="http://git-scm.com/documentation"> other useful resources</a>.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://book.git-scm.com/"> Git Community Book</a> is a wonderful resource for more in depth explanation of git's features.</li>
  <li>Many git users chat on the #git channel on IRC</li>
</ul>
