    <h3>Patching individual files</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="body">
    <p><a href="{% url mysite.missions.diffpatch.views.patchsingle_get_original_file %}">Here is a file</a> that contains a piece of code that could be implemented in a much better way.  Let's say that this file is part of a project you are working on, and somebody has come along, noticed the piece of code that could be improved, and <a href="{% url mysite.missions.diffpatch.views.patchsingle_get_patch %}">gave you a patch with the improved code</a>.</p>
    <p>In order to review the changes, you'll need to apply the patch to the file using the <code>patch</code> program, and your mission is to do that.</p>

    <p>One way to accomplish this is by running a command like <pre>patch -p0 &lt; patch_file</pre> from the command-line, in the directory containing both <code>patch_file</code> and the original file (replace <code>"patch_file"</code> with the actual name of the file you downloaded). This command says "use the patch program to apply the diff in <code>patch_file</code> to a file in the current directory". You can read more about the <code>patch</code> program in its <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/patch">man page</a> (or type <code>man patch</code> at the command-line).</p>

    <form method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data" action="{% url mysite.missions.diffpatch.views.patchsingle_submit %}#patchsingle-form">{% csrf_token %}
      <div class="form-row file-upload-row">
        <a name="patchsingle-form"></a>
        After you patch the file, upload it here:
  {% if patchsingle_success %}
    <div class="successmsg">
      <p><strong>You have successfully completed this part of the mission.</strong></p>
      <p>The file you uploaded has the correct contents.</p>
    </div>
  {% endif %}
        {% if patchsingle_error_message %}
        <ul class="errorlist"><li>{{ patchsingle_error_message }}</li></ul>
        {% endif %}
        {{ patchsingle_form.patched_file.errors }}
        <div class="file-upload">
        {{ patchsingle_form.patched_file }}
        <input type="submit" value="Upload" style="float: none;" />
