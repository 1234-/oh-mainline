    <h3>Using diff and patch</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="body">
    <p>When you make changes to open source software, you need an efficient way to show other people your changes so your changes can be reviewed or applied.  The <code>diff</code> and <code>patch</code> programs are often used for this purpose.  The <code>diff</code> program analyzes the files you give it and outputs the differences between them in a compact, human-and-machine-readable format, and the <code>patch</code> program reads <code>diff</code> output and uses it to transform a copy of the original files into the modified files.  So to show other people the changes, you can send them <code>diff</code> output, and they can use the <code>patch</code> program to apply your changes to their copy of the files.  When <code>diff</code> output is used in this way, the output itself is often called a patch or a diff.</p>
    <p>This mission consists of four parts: diffing individual files, patching individual files, diffing entire directory hierarchies, and patching entire directory hierarchies.</p>
