    <h1>Training missions <em style="font-size: 13pt; color: #aaaaaa;">(beta)</em></h1>
    <p><strong>Training missions are currently under development</strong> as part of John's Google Summer of Code project, which you can <a href="https://openhatch.org/blog/2010/google-summer-of-code-project-training-missions/">read more about in the OpenHatch blog</a>.  Some things may not work correctly or may be incomplete.  Please <a href="http://openhatch.org/contact/">get in touch with us</a> and let us know what you think.
