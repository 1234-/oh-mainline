    <p>These missions will allow you to learn some skills that will help you successfully contribute to free/open source projects.</p>

    <p>We developed them as part of John's Google Summer of Code project, which you can <a href="https://openhatch.org/blog/2010/google-summer-of-code-project-training-missions/">read more about in the OpenHatch blog</a>.</p>

    <p>We're looking for feedback.  Please <a href="http://openhatch.org/contact/">get in touch with us</a> and let us know what you think. Our plan is to polish up these missions and then write a HOWTO guide explaining how other people can add their own missions.</p>

    <h2>Using tar</h2>
    <p>Learn how to work with tar archives.</p>

    <h2>Using diff and patch</h2>
