    <h2>About the training missions</h2>
    <p>Some video games have a “training level” where you can get shot
      at without dying. These training missions are a place to learn
      open source contribution skills without getting burned.</p>

    <p>A training mission shuns “manuals” and long, boring blobs
    of text. Instead it says, “Here’s a short, concrete task to
    perform. Interact with this web-based robot here, and it will tell
    you if you succeeded.”</p>

    <h2>Here's what we have so far</h2>

    <h3 class="nofloat">Using tar</h3>

    <h2>Where they came from, and where they're going</h2>
    <p>We developed with the help of Google Summer of Code. We wrote about the
      <a href="https://openhatch.org/blog/2010/the-thinking-behind-the-training-missions/">vision behind the training missions</a> on the OpenHatch blog.</p>

    <p>Our community of volunteers takes care of creating more missions and fixing bugs in them. We could use feedback, and if you want to jump in to help, we'd love to have you!
      <a href="http://openhatch.org/contact/">Get in touch with us</a> and let us know what you think (or how you want to help out!). If you get stuck, <a href="http://openhatch.org/wiki/Mission_help">read our tips</a>.
