Baba ganoush is a common Middle Eastern and Mediterranean dip with
a creamy, somewhat smoky flavor. It is usually eaten with pita bread
although naan or a crispy flatbread also work well.

Ingredients

    * 1 medium-large aubergine, any variety, 1 to 1½ pounds
    * 2 tablespoons raw tahini
    * Juice of 1 lime
    * 1 clove garlic, crushed
    * 3 tablespoons olive oil
    * ½ tsp salt
    * Paprika or cayenne pepper, as a garnish

Procedure

1.  Roast the aubergine. This can be done in a variety of ways, but the
    flesh should be fully cooked and the skin should be burned and falling
    off easily. An effective method is to prick the aubergine and place it
    a few inches under a broiler, turning it as the exposed skin blackens,
    about every 3-4 minutes. Place a pan underneath to catch the juices,
    and discard them.

2.  Scrape off the aubergine skin. It's all right if you miss a few
    burned bits.

3.  Finely chop or blend the aubergine flesh with the rest of the
    ingredients. The consistency should be smooth. Reserve a bit of the
    olive oil, and drizzle that over the top. Sprinkle with some paprika
    or cayenne. (I use lemon instead of lime juice.)
