This mission is to have you make modifications to a file and submit a
diff of them. The changes may seem a bit silly, but they will cause the
diff to contain examples of different types of changes - additions,
deletions, and changes. Here is what we want you to do to this file:

  0.  Make an exact copy of this step and place it before #1; change the
      copy's step number to be 0.

  1.  Keep an unmodified copy of this file handy; you'll need it to
      make the diff once you're finished.

  5.  Move this step so it comes between #1 and #2. (Again, don't
      renumber the steps.)

  2.  Try to keep the formatting intact, as the result file will be
      compared character-for-character. There is exactly one blank line
      between each paragraph and bullet point, and all indentation is
      done with spaces. There is never trailing whitespace.

  4.  Leave this step the way it is.

  6.  Make an exact copy of this step and place it before #1; change the
      copy's step number to be 0.

  7.  There is a typo in this step, which you should fix.

  8.  Save the changes and make a unified diff of your changes using the
      diff command. Submit the diff on the page from which you obtained
      this file.

Good luck!
