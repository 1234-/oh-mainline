## TWO DWO

== Conversations ==
* Talk about "user intake process" -- arriving to the site for the first time perhaps with Ziegs.
* Go through FIXMEs and look for high-priority stuff.

== Python ==
=== Citation ===
C * Don't make duplicate citations in the db when importing (enforce uniqueness of source, person, project, contributor_role, or something like that)
=== Project ===
=== Old stuff ===
C * Remove old models
C * Remove old tests.
C * Remove old views.
=== Slowloh ===
When querying Ohloh based on previous Ohloh queries, we should store and use Ohloh's project id where possible. for example, when we get information on someone's open source experience, that includes Ohloh ID for that experience (the "analysis"). Then when go hunting for icons, we should use the project_id in that analysis, not the project name. This will be an improvement on the proposed implementation of icon search (using project name) because that implementation depends on the correct project appearing the first n results of a full-text search.

== Portfolio editor ==
B * Add portfolio entries
    * Bind handlers on pf entry element creation
  
Unpublished pf entry (obviously with unsaved changes):

    *----------
    | Unpublished 
    | Save and publish
    | Delete
    *------------

Published pf entry with unsaved changes:

    *----------
    | Published 
    | Save 
    | Delete
    *------------

Published pf entry with no unsaved changes:

    *----------
    | Published 
    | Saved
    | Delete
    *------------

B * big hello for newcomers to the portfolio editor, including information on what's a good citation.
B * pf entries imported via importer don't seem to get the unpublished class by default.
B * the panhandle of unpubbed pf entries is sometimes grey not yellow
C * ZIEGS Textareas labelled 'Project description' and 'Describe your involvement':
    Resting state: Just a paragraph of text. Pretty self explanatory. No field name needed.
    Click to edit. Reveal field name ("Project description" or "Describe your involvement").
    Onblur, save. Become a paragraph of text again.
D * Pre-populate project descriptions from Freshmeat, Wikipedia and SourceForge.
E * Project descriptions are pre-populated based on what users write.
D * "You don't have any contributions yet. Go here to remedy this..." help text when portfolio editor is blank
D * Cross browser compatibility testing
        with qunit
E * permit undeletion of pf entries?
Q * when a portfolio entry is published, flash green and fade to normal
Q * use jsmock in testing
P * profile javascript, especially the long time it takes to click 'Publish' and have the appearance of the pf entry change.

=== Citations ===
C * in citation summary, mention username
Q * when a citation is published, flash green and fade to normal
B * unpublished citations in published projects have a little green button labelled "publish"
D * say "Add a{,nother}record" depending on whether there's already one there.
C * remove citations from dom on delete
E * permit undeletion of citations?
C * think about how to make these grab more attention (perhaps embolden them)

== Portfolio viewer ==
C * Listing of other contributors.
C * When you click to edit a particular portfolio entry, the portfolio editor should pick up on that and use an hash/anchor to send you there.

== Importer ==
B * stop animating the progressbar when it's done
B * Importing behdad gives us ValueError: {'url': 'UNKNOWN', 'code': 'UNKNOWN'}
C * Save somewhere all the data we get from Ohloh, and the HTML we scrape from Launchpad.
D * add importer query to a history when the query is done
Q * visually cue the idea that the importer will stuff new things into the "edit all contributions" section of the portfolio editor. maybe with an arrow

== Deployment ==
E * ZIEGS Talk about making Javascript production ready within Django (minified; glomping together in one file)
  * Populate the icons in the production db and filesystem. Do it 50 at a time so we don't exhaust our API key's limit.

== Development tools ==
F * WISH have git scream at me when i don't add a file with friendly extension.

== Wishlist ==
* look up how 'finally' works
* stop using make_twill_url
* go through FIXMEs
* talk about using namespaces in Django
* organic tabs css-tricks.com/organic-tabs

= After portfolio is kaput =
== VolOpps search engine ==
  * Filters on the left-hand bar on the search engine page.
    - language
    - whether it's good for newcomers
    - project classifiers (from debtags, and trove e.g. <http://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=list_classifiers>)
    - what platforms the software works in
    - the urgency of the bug
    - the status of the bug.

== Blog posts ==
C * Django plus FireUnit
  * Using the Ohloh API: Stumbling blocks
  * Tab completion for Django test class names and method names.
  * Tab completion for manage.py when you're using Buildout.

----------------------------------------------------

Some difficulties arise when using John Resig's excellent JavaScript testing framework, FireUnit, in conjunction with Django. Some background first.

A:Whether running in production or locally, our JS unit tests, just like our Django unit tests, use their own data structures ('fixtures'), rather than manipulate the database, local or not. 

B: In fact, our JavaScript unit tests don't depend at all on the correct functioning of the server. They test the user interface exclusively. 

FIXME: Flip A and B. Talk about carefully separating the testing of the user interface from the testing of the business logic. 

In Django, the tests don't touch the database, but touch only testing-specific data. We recreate this environment in JavaScript by sending the tests input in the form of JavaScript objects.

The problem is that our more complex pages naturally interact with the DB. The portfolio editor, for instance, asynchronously pulls portfolio data from the DB and stuffs it into the <abbr title="Document Object Model: JavaScript's representation of the HTML document.">DOM</abbr>. If we run FireUnit tests on those, then the data in the page will originate partly in the database and partly in the JS unit test fixtures.
