### Other maintenance tasks ###

### Adding jQuery UI components ###

When you want to add a jQuery UI component, go here:

    http://jqueryui.com/download

Select the following options, plus yours:

* Sortable
* Accordion
* Tabs
* Progressbar

Note that the site will automatically select any dependencies (like jQuery UI's "Core").

First, under "Theme", select "No Theme". Under "Version", select "1.7.2 (stable release, for jQuery 1.3.2). Then click your little cartoon hand on the Download button.

Unzip the file in /tmp/, and just extract the file js/jquery-ui-1.7.2.custom.min.js, and cp it to mysite/static/js/. That will overwrite the existing jQuery UI bundle.

Be sure to check using git diff that the change you've introduced in git's view of that file is exactly what you expect.

Finally, don't forget to add your component to the list above, so the next person does the right thing.
